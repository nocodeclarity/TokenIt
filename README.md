# TokenIt

Real Estate Tokeniztion on Bitcoin.

TokenIt is a Clarity smart contract that allows for the tokenization of real estate, with equity stakes purchased under the term of a one-year lock-up period, after which they can be sold. Users can buy and sell tokens representing equity in the property, as well as transfer them to other addresses, using the TokenIt contract. The owner has the ability to withdraw accumulated funds, update the token price, and extend the lock-up period. TokenIt can do the following:

+ Users can send tokens to a different address.

+ Users can purchase tokens by sending the equivalent amount in fungible tokens to the TokenIt smart contract.

+ Users can sell tokens in exchange for fungible tokens based on the current token price.

+ Users can get the current token price.

+ Users can see the lockup period's length.

+ The owner can withdraw any accumulated funds.

+ The owner can change the price of each token.

+ The owner can modify the lockup period's length.

+ Tokens can be burned, which reduces the number of tokens in circulation when they are sold or transferred.

TokenIt is a preliminary ideation on what's possible if we combined real estate with a Clarity smart contract. It is important to note that the TokenIt smart contract has not been audited, the legal implications have not been explored prior to the publishing of this open source Clarity smart contract and the potential tax implications of TokenIt may carry varying outputs of fiscal responisbility in various jurisdictions around the world. Use at your own risk.

NoCodeClarity believes in the power of Bitcoin and Stacks so it's important that TokenIt is open source
